When selected, then the NeoLoad GUI is displayed during the test. Note that the user launching the process must be able 
to display a user interface 
(which is not always the case for the Jenkins user). Note also that some errors or warning messages may prevent NeoLoad from closing 
automatically at the end of a test run. Thus this should only be used for testing purposes.
